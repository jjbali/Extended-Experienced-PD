Reroll if there is no legal target. \n\nCreates a bomb explosion at the target location. \n\nSpread 33 electric fields for 10 rounds on the spot and get charging buff for 30 rounds. \n\n_2.25%_probability:\n\nChanging sheep (ineffective for bosses and minibosses), transforming the target into a sheep. Reroll if there is no legal target. \n\nCursed equipment is equivalent to a cursed trap. \n\n; Upward cross-layer teleportation (the larger the span, the lower the probability of teleportation)\n\n; Summoning monsters is equivalent to summoning traps. \n\n_0.25%_probability situation:\n\nThe whole layer grows grass and ignites several flames (average 5 places)\n\nSummon golden treasure monsters with no less than +1 items, none Legal location is reroll. \n\nBecame a random equipment, upgraded by 1 level and must be cursed. \n\nNothing happens (English means to force quit the game, but generally it does not affect the archive).

custom.dict.dict.info_ring=Ring
custom.dict.dict.info_ring_d=Ring effects are calculated by effect level. \n\nFor uncursed rings, effect level = actual level + 1; for cursed rings, effect level = ring level - 2, but not more than 0. \n\nWhen two identical rings are equipped, the effect level of each ring is calculated independently, and the effect level is added to determine the effect. \n\nNaturally generated rings: 2/3 probability +0, 4/15 probability +1, 1/15 probability +2. The imp's ring has an extra 2 ranks and must be cursed. \n\nNaturally generated rings have a 30% chance of being cursed. \nAppraisal\nDetermining the ring requires level 1 experience.

custom.dict.dict.info_artifact=Artifact
custom.dict.dict.info_artifact_d=Each artifact can only be spawned once per game. If the artifact has already been fully generated, doing the transmutation will do nothing and the artifact in the crystal chest will be replaced with the ring. \n\nThe displayed level of artifacts is the maximum level 10, but the actual level of some artifacts is not 10, such as hourglass, chain, and sandals. \n\nArtifacts have a lower probability of spawning than other items. \n\nNaturally generated artifacts have a 30% chance of being cursed.


custom.dict.dict.info_scroll=Scroll
custom.dict.dict.info_scroll_d=Scrolls of Identification and Exorcism are the most common scrolls (except for Upgrades, which are generated separately). Every locked scroll room must have a identification or exorcism. \nEach shop will also refresh the identification, exorcism and exploration scrolls. \n\nExcept for upgrades, all other scrolls can be destroyed by fire. \n\nSort of the natural generation ratio of various scrolls: (not counting upgrades)\n\nAppraisal>Exorcism>Mirror Image=Recharge=Teleportation>Earth Exploration=Revenge=Fear\n=Rage=Hypnosis>Transmutation. The hidden scroll room has an opposite probability distribution, making it easier to find rarer scrolls.

custom.dict.dict.info_potion=Potion
custom.dict.dict.info_potion_d=Potions are divided into beneficial potions and harmful potions. Paralyzing gas, frost, poisonous gas, and flame potion are harmful potions thrown by default. \n\nThe mechanism of brewing potions in the current version is:\n\nThree different seeds: 50% to generate completely random potions, 50% probability to determine potions based on seeds. \n\nTwo identical seeds: 33% generate completely random potions, 67% determine potions based on seeds. \n\nThree identical seeds: 100% generate the corresponding potion. \n\nThe above rules are not fully applicable to Yangchuncao (as the number of brewing treatments increases, the probability will decay). \n\nThe order of potion generation probability (strength is not included): Healing > Vision > Frost = Liquid Fire = Poison Gas > Invisibility = Float = Paralysis = Purification = Speed > Experience. The hidden alchemy room is the opposite.

custom.dict.dict.info_lim_drop=Healing Potion Limit Drop
custom.dict.dict.info_lim_drop_d=Healing potion drops are limited in dungeons (except wealth, which is not affected). \n\nThere is an upper limit on the monster's healing potion drop. The upper limit of flies is 5, necromancer 6, bat 7, dwarf warlock 8, demon blood lair must drop but only 4. \n\nThere is also a limit to brewing, up to 10 bottles. Brewed healing has a chance to be replaced with a random other potion. \n\nLimit the impact of dropping on the explosion rate: the explosion rate is reduced to (upper limit - dropped number)/(upper limit) times.


custom.dict.dict.info_food=Food
custom.dict.dict.info_food_d=One food is generated per normal tier (80% dry food, 20% pie). \n\nThe maximum hunger level is 450. Small portion of dry food, all kinds of meat restore 150 hunger points, dry food 300, pie and tasteless fruit (including tasteless fruit pieces) 450, synthetic whole meat flatbread 450+450. \n\nThe starvation state is resolved every 10 rounds. \n\nIn the state of extreme hunger, 1% of life will be lost every 10 rounds. \n\nSearching takes 2 rounds, but consumes 6 points of hunger.

custom.dict.dict.info_priority = Role Priority
custom.dict.dict.info_priority_d=All characters in the dungeon have action priority. \nThe priority of updating the field of vision is the highest, followed by characters, then environmental effects (such as gas), and then other creatures (some of which have a higher priority, such as Baiyou, mirror images, and spirit soil guards), and finally various buffs Settlement (some buffs have high priority, such as healing). \n\nThe characters determine the order of actions based on a common time axis. The one that consumes less time is given priority. When these characters all need to act at a time point, they will act in descending order of priority. \n\nUsing priorities wisely is also a skill. For example, monsters cannot escape the diffused gas along a straight line (because the gas diffuses and works first, and then the monster takes action).

custom.dict.dict.info_hero=Hero
custom.dict.dict.info_hero_d=The maximum level of a hero is 30. If you upgrade after level 30, you will get a blessing for 30 rounds. \n\nThe hero's initial hit attribute is 10, and the dodge attribute is 5. \n\nEvery time you upgrade, the hero hits +1, dodges +1, and maximum life +5. \n\nThe hero itself does not have any attribute resistance. \n\nAs the dungeon deepens, hidden terrain becomes harder and harder to find. The probability of passive perception to discover hidden doors is 0.2-floors/100 (it cannot be passively discovered after 20 floors), and the probability of discovering traps is 0.4-floors/250. The cursed talisman of vision reduces passive perception to 0.

custom.dict.dict.info_mob=Mob
custom.dict.dict.info_mob_d=Each mob has a maximum level. When your level is higher than the monster's maximum level, you can't gain experience from defeating monsters. When your level is higher than the monster's maximum level + 2, defeating the monster will not drop any items, and will not trigger the effect of the ring of wealth. \n\nThe closer you are to the monster, the easier it is for the monster to spot you. The probability of being discovered by sleeping monsters is 1/(distance+stealth), and the probability of being discovered by wandering monsters is 1/(distance/2.0+stealth). Engraving can reduce the probability of being discovered.

custom.dict.dict.info_property=Monster Properties
custom.dict.dict.info_property_d=Some monsters have specific properties. Certain attributes can make it gain some resistance and immunity. (With resistance, the effect is reduced by half, and with immunity, it is completely invalid)\nboss attributes: revenge, blast scroll, instant death resistance, assimilation effect (that is, the effect of becoming a friendly unit, such as corruption), hostile runestones, and immunity to soul flying . \n\nSmall boss attributes (monsters such as blue crabs): immune to assimilation effects, souls scattered\n\nUndead, demon attributes: none\n\nNon-creatures: bleeding, poison gas, poisoning immunity\n\nFire attributes : Immune to Flame Enchanting, Flame Rod Resistance\n\nAcid Attribute: Immune to Corrosive Sludge, Acid Erosion Resistance\n\nElectric Attribute: Various Electric Shock Resistance\n\nIce Attribute: Resist Frost Rod, immune to frost, freezing\n\nHuge size: unable to enter aisles and doors with a width of 1\n\nThe above are the inherent resistance and immunity of the attribute, monsters may have various settings in addition Resistance immunity.

custom.dict.dict.info_spawn=Monster Spawn
custom.dict.dict.info_spawn_d=The number of spawned monsters has a certain pattern. When entering a layer for the first time, the layer will generate _3+0~3+the number of layers in the current area_only monsters (except special layers). The dark layer generates 50% more monsters. Wide floors generate 33% more monsters. \n\nOne monster is refreshed every 50 rounds, the dark layer (referring to the dark feeling, not the challenge) monster spawning efficiency is increased by 50%, the return trip of the talisman clears the original monsters, the spawning interval is 5 current monsters, and between Between 5 and 25, the interval is further shortened by 60% on the first floor. \n\nMonsters will only spawn out of view. \n\nEvery time a monster is generated, it has a 0.02 probability of becoming a corresponding elite monster. \n\nCross-layer spawning also exists. \n\nThere is a 2.5% probability of generating a thief on the 4th floor\n\n2.5% probability of generating a bat on the 9th floor\n\n2.5% probability of generating a dwarf corpse on the 14th floor\n\n2.5% probability of generating a succubus on the 19th floor


custom.dict.dict.info_shop=Shop
custom.dict.dict.info_shop_d=The shop will always generate the following items:\n\nWeapons, armors, throwing weapons corresponding to the current chapter, random drugged darts\n\nOne identification map for exorcism, random scroll 0~ 2 pieces\n\nOne bottle of healing potion; 3~5 bottles of random potion\n\nSmall dry food, bomb or bee jar\n\nCross, package, enhanced runestone, alchemy rhomboid\n\nStore price It is (1+layer number/5) 5 times (integers are reserved in brackets). \n\nThe store will refresh the package according to the number of your items. When going downstairs, the item type that occupies the most grids in the backpack will generate the corresponding backpack.

custom.dict.dict.info_feeling = Feeling
custom.dict.dict.info_feeling_d=Each floor has a certain probability of various feelings, and the probability of each feeling is 1/14. \n\nSense of Vegetation: The vegetation coverage rate of this layer has been greatly increased\n\nSense of Darkness: The field of view of this layer has been halved, and the number of monsters and refresh rate have increased\n\nSense of Flowing Water: This layer is almost covered by water\n\n Suspended feeling: This floor is the flyover floor, and all aisles become skybridges\n\nSecret feeling: This floor generates an additional hidden room, and a large number of hidden doors are generated\n\nTrap feeling: This floor increases 400% of the explicit traps. \n\nExpansive feeling: the number of rooms on this floor is increased by 50%, the initial number of monsters is increased by 33%, the number of items generated is increased by 2, and an additional hidden room may be generated.

custom.dict.dict.info_chasm = Chasm
custom.dict.dict.info_chasm_d=Monsters that fall into chasms will die instantly and gain half experience. \n\nHeroes who fall into the crack will lose half of their health, and if less than half of their health, they will lose 0~1/4 of their maximum life or half of their life, whichever is greater. And according to the additional bleeding of the life before falling, the initial value is 1/(12-6 blood loss percentage) of the maximum life. \n\nItems that fall into the cracks will be generated at random locations on the next floor (but will not fall into special rooms and hidden rooms, and the boss floor is fixed next to the stairs). However, the potion will shatter and the seeds will grow directly.

custom.dict.dict.info_lck_floor = Floor Lockout
custom.dict.dict.info_lck_floor_d=Player will not reduce hunger during floor lockout. \n\nDuring the floor blockade, players can gain recovery time by inflicting damage on the boss. Attack spawned mobs cannot gain recovery time. \n\nEvery time you deal 1 point of damage to the boss, you can get n rounds of recovery time. During this period, your health will recover at the passive speed, and the recharging of staff and artifacts will also proceed normally. \n\nValues: Goo: 2; Tengu: Phase 1 1, Phase 3 4; DM-300: 1.5; Dwarf King: 0.33; Ancient God: 1\n\nThe floor block has an initial recovery time of 50 rounds . \n\nThe recovery time of 2 rounds will be deducted for each point of health that Slime recovers through the water surface.

custom.dict.dict.info_ranking = Ranking
custom.dict.dict.info_ranking_d=Leaderboards are ranked from high to low by score. \n\nScore calculation formula: score = (progress points + collection points + exploration points + boss points + task points) challenge multiplier clearance multiplier. \n\n_Progress points_=The deepest floor level is 65, the upper limit is 50,000, and the upper limit is reached at level 30 and 26th floor. \n\n_Collection Points_The upper limit is 20,000, which is equal to the sum of the number of gold coins collected + the original price of all items in the backpack. \n\n_Exploration points_=Number of ordinary floors experienced. The number of ordinary floors explored is 50, and the upper limit is 20,000. The conditions for full exploration are:\n1) find all items, open all containers, and collect all keys\n2) clear sacrificial fire, magic fire wall, living stone statues, treasure box monsters\n3) clear all obstacles and locked doors , use all keys, find all hidden doors. \n\n_Boss battle_ scoring rules are as follows. \n\nSticky: The maximum score is 1000, and the full score is 1050. The boss restores HP -10 each time in the water, and -200 each time it receives a charged attack. \n\nTengu: The full score is 2000. Every time you are hit by a special ability -100, stepping on a poison dart trap -100. \n\nDM300: The full score is 3000. Every time you get an electric shock from the surface wire - 200, receive an electric shock from an energy tower - 100, and receive a dm300 rockfall attack - 100. \n\nDwarf King: The full score is 4000. Each shot by the warlock -400. \n\nyog: out of 10000 points. The base score is 5000, and each time you receive a laser attack from the main body -500. Each blood nest survives +1250. \n\nThe full score in the BOSS battle is 20,000. There is no lower limit for deduction points for each boss, but negative points will be treated as 0 during settlement. \n\n_Mission_: The missions of the four districts are 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 points respectively. If the corpse dust is not returned, there will be points. \n\n_Challenge multiplier: _0 challenge is 1, each challenge has a multiplier of 1.25, accurate to 0.05. The multiplier of 9 challenges is 7.45. \n\n_Clear rate_: 1 for being covered in scars, 2 for clearing the level but not carrying the amulet to the ground, and 2.5 for returning to the ground with the amulet. \n\nOther factors do not participate in the score calculation.

custom.dict.dict.info_bones=Hero Bones
custom.dict.dict.info_bones_d=Hero bones are generated on the last stack of death. \n\nIf _Challenge_ is enabled, or _Custom Seed_ is used, or _Amulet_ has been obtained, or _Death location is 5 layers away from the deepest layer_, the remains will not be generated. \n\nGreater possibility of generation (2/3): an item in the equipment column (1/7 for each equipment column) or shortcut column (2/7 in total), if the corresponding column does not exist, it can be in the remains Generated items return to the initial re-judgment. \n\nSmall probability generation (1/3): an item in the backpack (quantity is 1~(quantity+1)/2), if there are less than three items, use gold coins to replenish to three. If the coin is more than 100, it will inherit the amount of 50~the original coin/2, and if it is less than 100, it will give 50 gold coins. \n\nSome items cannot be generated in the remains, such as the initial weapons of each profession (including throwing), items with valuable properties (dew bottles, etc.). \n\nIf it is equipment, it will inherit the original level, but not more than +3; if it is an artifact, it will return to level 0. \n\nOnly one remains can exist. \n\nOne save can open multiple remains. For example: save 1 dies on the 3rd floor, save 2 to open the remains on the 3rd floor, and save 3 dies on the 4th floor before the save 2 enters the 4th floor, then the save 2 enters the 4th floor at this time to find the corresponding remains.

custom.dict.dict.fight_mech = Fight Mech
custom.dict.dict.fight_mech_d=A normal physical attack is divided into several fixed steps. \n\n1. Give attack. The attacker gives the specific information of the attack, including damage, hit, etc. \n\n2. Hit check. The attacking and defending sides carry out the correction and calculation of hit and dodge, and put together points within the range of 0~final hit and 0~final dodge. If the attacking side does not fail, it is a hit. \n\n3. Prefix. The attacking and defending sides adjust the damage and defense according to the special state. \n\n4. Defender correction. The defending side settles defensive special effects (such as armor engraving) and applies a correction to the damage. \n\n5. Armor reduction. Subtract damage from armor. \n\n6. Offensive correction. The attacking party settles attack special effects (such as weapon special effects), and corrects the damage again. \n\n7. Take damage. The defender makes final corrections to the calculated damage, such as resistance and immunity. \n\n8. Final settlement. The defender takes the damage and deals with the result of the attack. \n\n"Spell Attack" skips steps 3~6.

custom.ch.mimic.mimicdocs.general=There are five types of Mimic attribute modifiers: basic, resistance, attack, defense, and support. \n_Basic_Entries modify the basic values of the monsters, such as health, attack power, etc. \n_Resistance_ entries are proportionally reduced for specific types of damage. \n_Attack_entries tend to cause damage and apply effects to the enemy. \n_Defense_ entries are biased towards reducing damage. \n_Auxiliary_entries interfere with opponents through various abilities. \n\nThe monster spawns with some basic entries, a resistance entry, and some offensive and defensive auxiliary entries. \n\nThere are four types of monsters: mixed, offensive, defensive, and auxiliary. \n\n_Mixed_ Mimics have no specific tendency to spawn. \n_Offensive_type monster must have attack and offensive entries. \n_Defensive_ type monster must have life and defense items. \n_Auxiliary_ type monsters must have movement speed and auxiliary items. \n\nThe above entries must be generated, and the level will be relatively high (the hybrid type has a random high level). \n\nThe level is randomly selected when the entry is generated. If it is level 0, it will have no effect and will not be displayed. The entry generation level will gradually increase as the level of the treasure box monster rises. \n\nGolden monsters have miniboss attributes.
