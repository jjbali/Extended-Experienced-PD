actors.mobs.dm100.zap_kill=The lightning bolt killed you...
actors.mobs.dm100.desc=The DM-100 is an early model of dwarven 'defense machine' which was designed to protect dwarven miners in the caves below this prison. Their electrical shocks proved too weak however, and so they were gifted to the human city above.

However, as the prisoners became more unruly they became a necessity.

In exchange for the lack of mobility, DM-201s have significantly more durability and attacking power.\n\nAs DM-201s have no engine to vent exhaust from, the dwarves instead outfitted them with corrosive gas grenades! DM-201s are careful with these grenades however, and will only lob them when attacked from a distance.

DM-300 can also connect to an energy grid, further enhancing its power.
